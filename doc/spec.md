MCRHDL Pipeline

RHDL
- Tokenizer converts code to tokens
- Parser converts tokens to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Evaluator converts the AST into a CGR
- CGR is converted to CGB using the CGRC

RHDL Virtual Machine
- Interprets Component Graph Bytecode (CGB)
- CGB generated by the Component Graph Representation Compiler (CGRC)
- Implementations of a Component Graph Designer (CGD) will follow the specification of the CGB to generate representations
- RHDL is a CGD

Acronyms:
- CGR:  Component Graph Representation
- CGRC: Component Graph Representation Compiler
- CGD:  Component Graph Designer
- CGB:  Component Graph Bytecode
